# ReUseMind AI ♻️  
### Intelligent Product Reuse & Repair Decision Assistant

ReUseMind AI is an AI-powered decision-support system designed to promote responsible consumption by helping users decide whether to reuse, repair, donate, resell, or recycle household products.

This project focuses on **waste prevention before disposal**, aligning with **UN SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production**.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement
Many usable products are discarded due to lack of awareness or convenience-based decision-making. Existing solutions focus on waste management after disposal rather than prevention.

**How might we use AI to guide users toward sustainable decisions before products become waste?**

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
ReUseMind AI analyzes:
- Product type  
- Product age  
- Condition (working / damaged / partially working)  

Based on sustainability reasoning, it recommends the most environmentally responsible action:
- Reuse  
- Repair  
- Donate  
- Resell  
- Recycle (last option)

Each recommendation includes:
- Clear reasoning  
- Environmental benefit explanation  
- Safe guidance (no harmful advice)
